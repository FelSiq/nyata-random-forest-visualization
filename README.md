# Nyata: visualization and analysis of Decision Tree and Random Forest models
- Web platform to visualize and interpret Random Forests and Decision Tree models.
- Compatible with scikit-learn tree and forest models.
- Can be used with both Classification and Regression models.

# Main features
- The platform works with sklearn Random Forest Classifiers and Regressors, and Decision Tree Classifiers and Regressors;
- Model parameter summary and statistics;

# Development
This platform is currently under development. The majority of the main features are finished. It just requires more testing, some polishment, and minor corrections.
