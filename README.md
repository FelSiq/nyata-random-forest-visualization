# Nyata: random forest model visualization and analysis
Techniques to better visualize Random Forests and Decision Tree models.

This platform summarizes model statistics and analytics, alongside a interactive view of each tree in the forest model.

# Main features
- The platform works with sklearn Random Forest Classifiers and Regressors, and Decision Tree Classifiers and Regressors;
- Model parameter summary and statistics;

# Current development
This platform is currently under development. The majority of the main features are finished. It just requires more testing, some polishment, and minor corrections.
